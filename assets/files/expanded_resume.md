## Professional Summary
Highly skilled and dedicated Computing Science student with a strong capacity for collaborative work and a keen interest in developing innovative projects. I offer proficiency in a broad range of computer languages and technologies. My career objective is to leverage my technical skills and collaborative experiences to contribute to cutting-edge projects in the field of computing science.

## TECHNICAL SKILLS
**Computer Languages:** Proficient in Python, Julia, RISC-V Assembly, C, C++, JavaScript, Bash, HTML/CSS.

**Framework:** Demonstrated expertise in TensorFlow, RL-Glue, Scikit-learn, Django, Flask.

**Technologies:** Proficient in Git, MySQL, Leafletjs API, and OpenWeather API.

## PROJECTS
**[SkyNav](https://skynav.pythonanywhere.com/)** — Python, Scikit-learn, Flask, JavaScript, HTML, CSS

Developed a sophisticated real-time navigation system, SkyNav, aimed at guiding small aircraft, helicopters, and drones towards their destination in a secure and efficient manner.

**[Math-Vision-Model](https://github.com/BetterThanYou73/tensorflow-math-vision)** — Python, TensorFlow, Matplotlib

Constructed a machine learning model that leverages probabilistic distribution in TensorFlow to predict characters in images. Utilized Python and Matplotlib for comprehensive data visualization and analysis.

**[Math-Vision-OCR](https://github.com/BetterThanYou73/math-vision)** — Python, TensorFlow

Created a user-friendly GUI that pulls models from my database and employs the model’s character prediction to solve simple mathematical equations.

**[natHACKS 2023 - Video Game](https://github.com/GOATMaxwellN/Nightmares)** — Unity, C#, C++

Contributed to the development of a novel video game, which personalizes the player's experience based on their ECG data to create unique gameplay dynamics.
